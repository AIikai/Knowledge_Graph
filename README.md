# Tsinghua_AI_ZiQiang
An introductory course in computer vision from the Data Science Institute of Tsinghua University.

Since the first lecture, I have been listening to every course. This course is taught by a postgraduate student at Tsinghua University. The goal is that the young lady of the liberal arts can understand the field of artificial intelligence. A good course, it deserves to be recommended. Here, I will share the course PPT and link address, as well as homework assignments. I hope everyone will gain something.
